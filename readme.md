# Data Cleaning Steps for K-Means Clustering

## 1. Understand Your Data

- **Familiarize yourself with the dataset**: Understand the variables, their types, and the domain context.
- **Define the objective**: Clearly outline what you aim to achieve with clustering.

## 2. Handle Missing Values

- **Identify missing values**: Check for NaNs or nulls.
- **Imputation**: Depending on the nature of the data, you can impute missing values using methods like mean, median, mode, or more sophisticated techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation.
- **Remove rows/columns**: If the proportion of missing values is high, it might be better to remove those rows or columns.

## 3. Remove Outliers

- **Detect outliers**: Use statistical methods like Z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range), or visualization techniques like box plots to detect outliers.
- **Handle outliers**: Depending on their impact, you might choose to remove or transform outliers.

## 4. Normalize/Standardize the Data

- **Normalization**: Scale the data to a range, typically 0-1. This is useful if the data contains features of varying scales.
- **Standardization**: Adjust the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is particularly important for algorithms like K-Means, which use Euclidean distance.

## 5. Feature Selection and Engineering

- **Select relevant features**: Keep only the features that are relevant to your clustering objective.
- **Create new features**: If necessary, create new features that may better represent the underlying patterns in the data.
- **Dimensionality reduction**: Consider techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the number of features while retaining important information.

## 6. Encoding Categorical Variables

- **Label Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using label encoding.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: For categorical variables with no ordinal relationship, use one-hot encoding to avoid introducing ordinal relationships.

## 7. Remove Redundant Features

- **Correlation analysis**: Remove features that are highly correlated with each other to reduce redundancy.
- **Variance Threshold**: Remove features with very low variance as they contribute little to the clustering.

## 8. Data Transformation

- **Log Transformation**: Apply log transformation to skewed data to make it more normally distributed.
- **Box-Cox Transformation**: Another method to stabilize variance and make the data more normal distribution-like.

## 9. Split Data (Optional)

- If you are validating the clustering results, split the data into training and test sets. However, this is more common in supervised learning.

## 10. Check for Data Consistency

- **Ensure consistency**: Make sure there are no inconsistencies, such as duplicated rows or anomalies introduced during the cleaning process.

## 11. Visualize the Data

- **Visualize distributions**: Use histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc., to
  understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
- **Check for patterns**: Ensure the data is well-prepared for clustering by visualizing potential patterns and clusters.
